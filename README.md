Universe SQL Database
Overview
This project represents the Universe SQL Database created as part of the freeCodeCamp Relational Database course. It is designed to simulate the structure of a universe with different celestial objects, such as stars, planets, moons, and galaxies. The database includes multiple tables, relationships, and constraints that allow for efficient storage and retrieval of data regarding these celestial bodies.

The project demonstrates fundamental concepts in SQL and relational database management, such as table creation, foreign key constraints, indexing, data types, and querying. It serves as a hands-on example of how to design and work with relational databases.

Technologies Used
SQL: Used to define, manage, and query the database.
PostgreSQL: The relational database management system (RDBMS) used to implement and manage the database.
Features
Created and managed tables for planets, stars, galaxies, moons, and other celestial objects.
Implemented relational data structures using primary and foreign keys.
Applied constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK to ensure data integrity.
Developed queries for data retrieval, including complex JOIN operations.
Utilized indexing and optimization techniques to improve query performance.
Project Completion
This project was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Relational Database course in November 2024.
